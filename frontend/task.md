The Challenge
Build a full-stack system that parses resumes, extracts candidate information, and uses an AI
agent to autonomously collect PAN and Aadhaar documents.
Context: An HR team uploads a candidate's resume. Your system extracts their details, then an
AI agent intelligently requests identity documents via their email or phone.
What to Build

Frontend
● Drag-and-drop resume upload with progress
● Candidate dashboard (table: name, email, company, extraction status)
● Candidate profile view showing extracted data + confidence scores
● Button to trigger document request
● Section to view/upload submitted documents
